# Donations

Ubiq is a no ICO, no premine smart contract platform.

Don't feel obligated to donate and it is purely optional. A lot of people in crypto can't contribute code (and devs are hard to come by) but they can contribute some coins so it all works out :slightly_smiling_face:. This page was set up so that you can donate to some people who have contributed code either directly or indirectly to Ubiq.

We currently don't have a system for bounties so this will do for now.
